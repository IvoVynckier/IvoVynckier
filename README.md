Iâ€™m the Belgian technical writer Ivo Vynckier (@IvoVynckier).

I researched, wrote and developed 2 technological web sites (https://how-ocr-works.com and https://spielberg-ocr.com) and 1 artistic web site (https://betty-bouckaert.be).

I use Git/GitHub to store the source files online.

You can e-mail me at ivo.vynckier@telenet.be.
